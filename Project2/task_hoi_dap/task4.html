      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        The use of masks for children of any age with developmental disorders,
        disabilities or other specific health conditions should not be mandatory and be assessed on a case by case basis by the child’s parent, 
        guardian, educator and/or medical provider. 
        In any case, children with severe cognitive or respiratory impairments with difficulties tolerating a mask should not be required to wear masks.

      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a <b>medical mask</b> in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness.

      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        <p>Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a <b>medical mask</b>, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask.</p>
        <p>A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time.</p>

     Should Children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical active ?

    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use.

        <p>WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. An international and multidisciplinary expert group brought together by WHO reviewed evidence on COVID-19 disease and transmission in children and the limited available evidence on the use of masks by children.</p>
        <p>Based on this and other factors such as childrens’ psychosocial needs and developmental milestones, WHO and UNICEF advise the following:</p>
        <p>Children aged <b>5 years and under</b> should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance.</p>
        WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged <b>6-11</b> should be based on the following factors:
        <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
            <li>Whether there is widespread transmission in the area where the child resides</li>
            <li>The ability of the child to safely and appropriately use a mask</li>
            <li>Access to masks, as well as laundering and replacement of masks in certain settings (such as schools and childcare services)</li>
            <li>Adequate adult supervision and instructions to the child on how to put on, take off and safely wear masks</li>
            <li>Potential impact of wearing a mask on learning and psychosocial development, in consultation with teachers, parents/caregivers and/or medical providers</li>
            <li>Specific settings and interactions the child has with other people who are at high risk of developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with other underlying health conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged <b>12 and over</b> should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.</p>
