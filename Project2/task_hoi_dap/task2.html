                  Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people
                  , so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease
                  . However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical problems like high blood pressure,
                  heart and lung problems, asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurological and developmental conditions are risk factors for severe disease 
                  and intensive care admission in children.

             Show i wear a mask at school or when playing sports ?

            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
               <p>
                You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene.

               </p>
               <p>Regarding wearing masks in schools and other public places, WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of the virus and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, WHO and UNICEF advise decision makers to apply the following criteria for use of masks in schools (either in classes, corridors or communal areas) when developing national policies:

               </p>
               <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                <li>Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.</li>
                <li>For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the child’s capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors.</li>
                <li>Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults</li>

              TIP 1: DO THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND MIND:
               <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                <li>Stay active! Being physically active is good for your body and can help your mind feel better too. If you can go outside, try a walk, run, bike ride, or any other sport. If indoors, try dancing, stretching, or any other movement you can do. Find what works for you – and do it!</li>
                <li>Eat well! Try to make healthy choices about what you eat if you can.</li>
                <li>Take notice of yourself and the world around you. This means becoming more aware of your breathing, your body and your surroundings. Try to BE PRESENT in the moment!</li>
                <li>Sleep! Try to get the right balance of sleep each night. This will help you grow well, stay healthy, and keep clear thoughts</li>
                <li>Find things that make you happy and do those things more! Listening to music, reading, playing games, chatting with friends, growing plants, cooking, drawing, playing sports…there are many possibilities! Perhaps even try something new! Just make sure that during these activities you respect physical distancing and other protection measures that are in place in your country.</li>
              </ul>
              TIP 2: STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONES:
              <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
              <li>Keep in touch with your family and friends however you can. Use social media, email, phone calls, write a letter! Be creative. And if you can’t connect, then think about a memory of a shared time together.</li>
              </ul>
              TIP 3: RECOGNISE HOW YOU ARE FEELING:
              <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                <li>Understanding how you feel is important. Don’t ignore it. Sometimes writing your feelings down can help you to describe it. It might sound easy or simple, but try this “I feel ....... right now”.</li>
              </ul>
              TIP 4: BE KIND TO YOURSELF:
              <p>It is okay to feel however it is that you’re feeling. Putting pressure on yourself to always ‘be happy’ or ‘stay positive’ or ‘stay productive’ can sometimes make you feel worse. Instead, if you notice you are experiencing difficult emotions, try telling yourself: “I feel worried and scared, but that does not mean I am not coping.” “It’s been a tough time, it’s okay to be upset.” “I am feeling [insert how you are feeling] and that is okay.” “These are difficult times, it’s normal to feel upset.”</p>
              TIP 5: LISTEN TO YOUR BODY:
              <p>Our body experiences and reacts to how we feel. Do you often get headaches? Do your shoulders, chest, or stomach sometimes feel tense? Try closing your eyes, and listening to your own breathing. Notice how you feel in each part of your body, starting from your head down to your toes. Notice if you are feeling any tightness, pain, or pressure in your body. Being aware of where you are feeling tension can help you release </p>
              TIP 6: TRY USING YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELF
              <p>Slow breathing is one of the quickest ways of calming down the body when we experience feelings such as fear, worry or anger. Close your eyes and think of a calm place. Imagine yourself there, feeling relaxed.</p>
              <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                <li>Focus on breathing slowly.</li>
                <li>Breathe in for a slow count of 3 and out for a slow count of 3.</li>
                <li>Practice this for a few minutes.</li>
              </ul>

             What Should I Do If Someone in my family get really il with COVID-19 ?

          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              <p>Immediately seek medical care if a member of your family gets seriously ill, for example develops difficulty breathing or feels pain or pressure in the chest. If possible,
                 either you or an adult should contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out where and how you could get care. If your family member is confirmed as having COVID-19, 
                 you must be prepared that you and other known contacts will need to isolate for 14 days and monitor symptoms, even if you feel healthy.

             I Am Spending much more time online in social media, playing and studying.Should i be worried about this ?
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              <p>COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, 
                and you may be spending even more hours online than before.
                While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, 
                socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. 
                This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. 
                In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen.
                Therefore, it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities,
                like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog. 
                Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. 
                If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult. </p>
